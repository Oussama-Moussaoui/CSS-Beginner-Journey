# Sections 0 to 12:

All the sections 0 to 12 are things I learned while following the `Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)` Udemy Course from Brad Tarversy (hoster of Traversy Media). It is Great, take it!

# Sections 14+:

Sections 14 and more, are things I learned from the `Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!` Udemy Course, from Jonas Schmedtmann.
