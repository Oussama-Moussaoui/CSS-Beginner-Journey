# Using Grid In A Real World Project:
The project I worked on using what I learned in the Grid section (folder: 10 Grid) is a (fictional) news website - News Grid.  
Site: `https://newsawesome.ml/`    Or: `https://affectionate-ritchie-6aa274.netlify.app/`  
Code: `https://github.com/Oussama-Moussaoui/News-Website-With-Grid`
